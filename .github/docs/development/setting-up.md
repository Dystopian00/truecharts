# Setting up your dev environment

With TrueCharts we use some custom tools to make sure you have the least amount of work possible when working on the project.
However, this means you need some custom tools before you can start working on TrueCharts:

- Git (git client optional)
- Python (including Pip, added to path on windows)
- Pre-Commit (prefered)

## Windows

### GIT

- Download and install GIT (https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- Most default options would be fine

### Python
- Install Python3 with the installer (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Right click "Run as administrator"
- Check "Add to Path"
- Click the big install button

### Pre-Commit
- hit windows+r
- enter "cmd"
- In the new (black) windwos enter "pip install pre-commit"
