  # Port to host the web service on. This will be the internal container port exposed and needs to be the same as the public service port.
  # The main http port always has to be a 1:1 mapping between external and internal port.
  # You can't just map it like -p 9002:9000, as Logitech Media Server is telling players on which port to connect.
  # Therefore if you have to use a different http port for LMS (other than 9000) you'll have to set the HTTP_PORT environment variable
