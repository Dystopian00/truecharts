# Installation Notes

For the initial installation, you need to visit a URL with a different port that the `main` service.

The URL is: `http://your.server.ip:10233`
If you changed the `port` of service `Install Wizard`. Use that `port`.

After finishing initial setup, you can access WebUI via `http://your.server.ip:10232` (or use the `Open` button on Scale UI)
