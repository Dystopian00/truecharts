# Installation Notes

- Shell into the chart via the recyclarr cardview in Apps -> 3 dot -> shell.
- Set the `commands` to `/bin/bash`.
- Run the command below to init the recyclarr's files in `/config`.

```terminal
recyclarr create-config
```

:::info

To edit recyclarr's files in the /config dir, I highly recommend using the codeserver Addon-on. It offers a web based file editor. Its meant to be temporarily so you can add/remove it any time.
