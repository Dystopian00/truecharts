## Installation Notes

Our chart by default runs on interal port `443` however those not running `Ingress` may run into issues with other processes requesting port `443`.

**The Solution**

- Click `Advanced Settings`
- Change `Target Port` to 8043 to match the `external` port as below

## Finding APs / Omada Discovery Utility

By default the `omada-controller` chart doesn't support discovery by APs on the same network. 

**The solution**

- One must use the [`Omada Discovery Utility`](https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/download/omada-software-controller/#Omada_Discovery_Utility) and point APs to your `omada-controller`.
- Please follow the directions on the [TP-Link Website](https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/download/omada-software-controller/#Omada_Discovery_Utility) to download and use this utility. They have a nice [FAQ](https://www.tp-link.com/ca/support/faq/3087/) that may be of use.
