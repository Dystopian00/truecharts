description: Folding@home is a distributed computing project for simulating protein dynamics,
  including the process of protein folding and the movements of proteins implicated in a variety of diseases.
  It brings together citizen scientists who volunteer to run simulations of protein dynamics on their personal
  computers. Insights from this data are helping scientists to better understand biology, and providing new
  opportunities for developing therapeutics.
