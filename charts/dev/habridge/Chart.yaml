description: Habridge emulates Philips Hue API to other home automation gateways such as an
  Amazon Echo/Dot Gen 1 (gen 2 has issues discovering ha-bridge) or other systems that support
  Philips Hue. The Bridge handles basic commands such as "On", "Off" and "brightness" commands
  of the hue protocol. This bridge can control most devices that have a distinct API.
