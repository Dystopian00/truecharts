description: Dokuwiki is a simple to use and highly versatile Open Source wiki software that doesn't require a database.
  It is loved by users for its clean and readable syntax. The ease of maintenance, backup and integration makes
  it an administrator's favorite. Built in access controls and authentication connectors make DokuWiki
  especially useful in the enterprise context and the large number of plugins contributed by its vibrant
  community allow for a broad range of use cases beyond a traditional wiki.
