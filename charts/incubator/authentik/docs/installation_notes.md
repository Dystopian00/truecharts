# Installation notes

## Outposts

Enable each outpost by simple setting `enabled` to `true`.
Scale users, just have to check the checkbox

### Host

`host` should not need to be overridden. Defaults to `http://localhost:9000`

### Host Browser

`host_browser` by default is set to the first ingress host you set

### Token

`token` is only needed if you accidentally deleted it within the UI
