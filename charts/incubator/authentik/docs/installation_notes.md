# Installation notes

## Outposts

Under each outpost configuration you will find an `Override Token` (checkbox for Truenas Scale users)
or `overrideToken`(boolean for Native Helm Users).

This is only need to be set to true/checked only if you accidentally delete the API token within the UI.

Only when this is true/checked the `token` has effect.
