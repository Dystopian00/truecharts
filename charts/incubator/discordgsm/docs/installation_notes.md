# Installation Notes

- Set `App Token` to your discord bot token. Here's a basic guide from [discordGSM](https://discordgsm.com/guide/how-to-get-a-discord-bot-token).
- Set `Whitelist Guilds` to the server guild Ids if adding multiple Ids separate with `;`.

Add your discord bot if you haven't done so and run initial commands to get started with discordGSM.
