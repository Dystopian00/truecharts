# Installation notes

## Default Configuration

LLDAP is configured using the default options generated by the application on first run. The exception to this is the Base DN for LDAP option which has been exposed to the user.

On first login the username is 'admin' with the password as 'password'. For security reasons, please change this as soon as possible when logged in.

## Usage

LLDAP can be used as the user backend for Authelia and Authentik as well as any other application that supports LDAP.
