# Installation notes

## Default Configuration

LLDAP is configured using the default options as outlined in the app's [README.md](https://github.com/lldap/lldap/blob/main/README.md).

On first login the username is 'admin' with the password as 'password'. For security reasons please change this as soon as possible.

The only option that has been exposed is the Base DN for LDAP option where you may change this to suit your particular setup. A placeholder has been provided for you.

## Usage

LLDAP can be used as the user backend for Authelia and Authentik. Please see the README linked above for further information.
