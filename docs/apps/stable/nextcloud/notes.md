# Important Notes

Nextcloud is a VERY picky Application and is VERY hard to support.
For this reason we ask you not to file support requests on our Discord or Github, unless your issue is clearly caused by TrueCharts.

While we consider the App layer "Stable", we simply cannot guarantee stability due to the nature of the Nextcloud Application inside the App.
