### Supported operating systems

While we always aim for our charts to be fully stock-kubernetes compatbile, we can only guarantee compatibility with TrueNAS SCALE Apps. As we are primarily a TrueNAS SCALE App catalog.

Though we try to make our Apps as version independent as possible we have a limited capacity to support older versions of TrueNAS SCALE. Our focus is the current version of TrueNAS.

That being said: We do look forward to contributions to improve support for stock-kubernetes for our Charts!

### Development

Our development proces is fully distributed and agile, every chart-maintainer is free to set their own roadmap and development speed and does not have to comply to a centralised roadmap.

This ensures freedom and flexibility for everyone involved and makes sure you, the end user, always has the latest and greated of every App installed.

#### Roadmap

However for big "breaking" changes we do have a roadmap during the ALPHA and BETA stages of TrueNAS SCALE.
Assuming the release dates of TrueNAS SCALE will keep following the previous 2 months between releases, we will have the following big milestones:

---

- TrueCharts DB Edition - TrueNAS SCALE 21.06

_This release will focus on adding a solid framework of using (and adding) databases to Apps within TrueCharts. This will lead to significantly more App possibilities and performance increases for existing Apps._
