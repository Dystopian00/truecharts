# Apps GUI Suggestions

The goal is to gather some suggestions and forward them to iX-Systems.

##### Visual suggestions

- Use all screen on install / edit app, not just a sidebar. [NAS-110183](https://jira.ixsystems.com/browse/NAS-110183)
- Add more bulk options, like bulk upgrade and restart.
- Add sorting options in app catalog.
- Default tab should be "Installed Apps" or have an option to set the default.
- Make timezone searchable and sorted in Scale Apps installation [NAS-109524](https://jira.ixsystems.com/browse/NAS-109524)
- Add service information (Service name and ports) to the App Overview (In the card displayed when clicking an installed app).
- The "Application Events" in the App Overview should be shown in a similar UI widget as the container logs. This would improve the readability.
- The App overview card should be resizable, right now viewing application events is very limiting.
- Fix some of the themes to work with apps section. Light color themes like paper make it very hard to see if an app is up to date or requiring upgrade
- Installed apps status should be updated without the need to change view and come back. e.g After installing/updating an app, you will always see "Deploying" until you go to manage catalogs and come back to installed apps.

- :white_check_mark: Make timezone default to timezone set in TN System [NAS-110373](https://jira.ixsystems.com/browse/NAS-110373)
- :white_check_mark: Show all config options on "Confirm options" when installing an App

##### Technical suggestions

- Allow `show_if` and `show_subquestions_if` to to use values for evaluation from parent variables [NAS-110751](https://jira.ixsystems.com/browse/NAS-110751)
- Add option for separators and whitespace in questions.yaml [NAS-110750](https://jira.ixsystems.com/browse/NAS-110750)
- Validate regex defined in questions.yaml when focus leaves input field.
